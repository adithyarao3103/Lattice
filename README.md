# Lattice

Code written by me for a simple simulation of SU(2) gauge theories on a 1+1 dimensional lattice. 
There is a problem that the lattice is not thermalising but is rather oscillating wildly not reaching the ground state. The action is reaching values like -9.94465e+012 and on the other hand 6.01714e+012. 
Will take a deeper look at the problem when I get time!
